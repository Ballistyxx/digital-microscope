## Features
‚úî **High-resolution Raspberry Pi Camera**  
‚úî **15x zoom macro lens for detailed imaging**  
‚úî **Adjustable rack-and-pinion focus system**  
‚úî **Custom 3D-printed enclosure**  
‚úî **Built-in LED illumination powered by GPIO**  
‚úî **Physical shutdown button for safe operation**  

## Hardware Components
- **Raspberry Pi Zero**
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module**
- **15x Zoom Macro Lens**
- **Adjustable Rack & Pinion Focus System**
- **5V LED for Illumination**
- **Custom 3D-printed Enclosure**
- **Physical Power Button (GPIO Shutdown)**

## Software & Setup
The microscope uses **Raspbian Buster** and the `raspivid` command for real-time streaming. Setup steps include:

1. **Enable the Camera Stack** using `sudo raspi-config`
2. **SSH into the Raspberry Pi** using `ssh pi@<your-ip-address>`
3. **Run the Camera Stream** with the command:
   ```sh
   raspivid -t 0 -w 1920 -h 1080 -fps 30 -sa 10 -rot 180
   ```

### Example Wiring Diagram (Simplified)
```plaintext
[ Raspberry Pi ] --> [ Camera Module ]
                  --> [ LED (5V, GND) ]
                  --> [ Physical Shutdown Button (GPIO21, GND) ]
```
